monitor_vehicle_fleet_data:
  description: Continuously monitor real-time vehicle sensor data and telematics for
    all {oem_name} fleet vehicles (VEH001-VEH010). Analyze engine parameters, brake
    conditions, battery status, transmission health, tire pressure, diagnostic trouble
    codes, and usage patterns. Identify vehicles showing anomalous sensor readings
    or patterns that indicate potential maintenance needs. Create a comprehensive
    fleet health report with priority ranking based on urgency of maintenance requirements.
  expected_output: Detailed fleet monitoring report in JSON format containing vehicle-by-vehicle
    analysis with sensor readings, identified anomalies, maintenance alert flags,
    priority rankings (Critical/High/Medium/Low), and recommended immediate actions
    for vehicles requiring attention
  agent: data_analysis_agent
predict_component_failures:
  description: Using the vehicle data analysis and historical maintenance patterns,
    apply advanced failure prediction models to identify probable component failures
    for each vehicle. Analyze maintenance history, current sensor readings, usage
    patterns, and environmental factors to predict when specific components (engine,
    brakes, transmission, electrical systems) are likely to fail. Assign probability
    scores, confidence levels, and time-to-failure estimates for each predicted failure.
    Prioritize predictions based on safety criticality and cost implications.
  expected_output: Comprehensive failure prediction report in JSON format for each
    vehicle, containing component-specific failure probabilities, confidence levels,
    estimated time-to-failure (days/weeks/months), risk severity classification, safety
    impact assessment, and prioritized maintenance recommendations with cost-benefit
    analysis

engage_customers_with_maintenance_alerts:
  description: Based on the failure predictions and diagnosis results, proactively
    contact vehicle owners with personalized maintenance recommendations. Craft clear,
    non-alarming messages that explain the predicted maintenance needs, their urgency,
    and benefits of preventive action. Use customers' preferred communication methods
    (voice calls, mobile app notifications, SMS, email) and personalize messages based
    on vehicle history, customer preferences, and communication patterns. For critical
    issues, prioritize voice-based engagement with immediate follow-up via other channels.
  expected_output: Customer engagement summary report showing all attempted communications,
    message content used, delivery status for each customer, customer responses received,
    communication method effectiveness, engagement rates, and follow-up actions required
    for non-responsive customers

schedule_maintenance_appointments:
  description: Coordinate with customers who responded positively to maintenance alerts
    and schedule optimal appointments across the {oem_name} service center network.
    Check availability at service centers based on maintenance type, technician specialization,
    geographic proximity to customer, and urgency level. Use Iternio API to optimize
    service vehicle routes for electric vehicle service fleets, identify optimal charging
    stations, calculate energy consumption, and plan efficient routes between service
    locations. Balance critical repairs with routine maintenance to optimize service
    center workloads while considering electric vehicle range limitations and charging
    infrastructure. Consider customer preferences for appointment timing while ensuring
    maintenance deadlines are met. Handle appointment confirmations and provide customers
    with service center details, expected service duration, preparation instructions,
    and estimated arrival times for mobile service units.
  expected_output: Comprehensive appointment scheduling report containing confirmed
    appointments with date, time, service center details, customer information, service
    type, estimated duration, optimized service center workload analysis, electric
    vehicle route optimization results with charging station locations, energy consumption
    estimates, mobile service unit deployment schedule with charging plans, geographic
    distribution of appointments, and pending scheduling requests that require follow-up

collect_service_feedback_and_update_records:
  description: Track the progress of all scheduled service appointments until completion
    and systematically collect post-service feedback from customers. Monitor service
    completion status, send service completion notifications, and gather customer
    satisfaction ratings, service quality feedback, and suggestions for improvement.
    Update maintenance records with completed services, actual vs predicted issues
    found, service costs, and customer feedback. Identify patterns in service quality,
    technician performance, and customer satisfaction across different service centers.
  expected_output: Service completion and feedback analysis report containing service
    completion rates, customer satisfaction scores, feedback summaries, updated maintenance
    records, identified service quality trends, technician performance analysis, and
    recommendations for service process improvements

generate_manufacturing_quality_insights:
  description: Perform comprehensive RCA/CAPA-driven analysis by cross-referencing
    predicted failures with historical maintenance records, manufacturing defect data,
    and service feedback. Identify recurring failure patterns across the vehicle fleet,
    analyze manufacturing batch correlations, evaluate supplier quality trends, and
    generate actionable insights for the {oem_name} manufacturing teams. Focus on
    preventive actions, design improvements, and quality enhancements that can reduce
    future defects and improve product reliability.
  expected_output: Manufacturing quality improvement report containing RCA/CAPA analysis
    findings, recurring defect patterns, manufacturing batch issue identification,
    supplier quality assessments, design improvement recommendations, preventive action
    plans, projected quality improvement impact, and specific manufacturing process
    modifications to reduce field failures
